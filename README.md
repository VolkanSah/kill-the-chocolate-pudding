This is a game we play to not get even more stupid and to distract ourselves from work. The rules of the game are coming soon. The game is currently being played in German, English, Turkish and French.

 ## Five ways to "kill" your chocolate pudding after a hard working day:
- Hold a mock trial and sentence your chocolate pudding to death by spoonful. Accuse it of being too delicious and for distracting you from work.

- Pretend to stage an elaborate bank heist with your chocolate pudding as the unsuspecting victim. Put on a ski mask and demand that the pudding "hand over the goods" before devouring it.

- Dress up your chocolate pudding like a voodoo doll and "stab" it repeatedly with your spoon. Blame all your work-related stress on the pudding, and relish in the moment of sweet revenge.

- Pretend you're a giant monster and "attack" your chocolate pudding like a city under siege. Roar and stomp your feet, then chomp on your tasty "prey" until it's all gone.

- Imagine your chocolate pudding is a stubborn coworker who always gives you a hard time. Give it a stern talking-to about how it's not pulling its weight, and then eat it with satisfaction as your imaginary grievances are finally laid to rest.

### Remember
these are just some silly ways to enjoy your dessert and release some stress after a long day of work. Don't take them too seriously and enjoy your delicious chocolate pudding!
